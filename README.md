# ProxyNow

ProxyNow is an easy-to-use tool to launch and share proxies in just a couple of clicks. These proxies can help people in difficult situations currently facing internet censorship. We also host a platform to find live proxies that can be used.

# Setting up a WhatsApp Chat Proxy

If you are unable to connect directly to WhatsApp, a proxy can be used as a gateway between you and our servers. To help yourself or others re-establish connection to WhatsApp, you can set up a proxy server.

If you already have a proxy to use, you can connect it to WhatsApp by following the steps in this [article](https://faq.whatsapp.com/520504143274092).
