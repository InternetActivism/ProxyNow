# ProxyNow

ProxyNow is an easy-to-use tool to launch and share proxies in just a couple of clicks. These proxies can help people in difficult situations currently facing internet censorship.

### Setting up a WhatsApp and Telegram Chat Proxy

To help yourself or others re-establish connection to WhatsApp, you can set up a proxy server. You can easily set one up by following the steps for your platform on our site [here](https://proxynow.org/setup).

### Using a Proxy on WhatsApp or Telegram

If you are unable to connect directly to WhatsApp or Telegram, a proxy can be used as a gateway between you and an alternate server. [Click here](https://proxynow.org/use) to find more information about how to connect to a proxy on your device.

### Sharing Your Proxy

Once you have set up a proxy, you can share it with us to allow Iranians to bypass internet censorship and communicate with their loved ones. We will be working with our partner organizations to securely distribute the list of proxies to those who need it most.
